<h2>Te Anau and Milford Sound</h2>


  <p>During the summer, My family and I went down to Milford Sound as my brother Ivan was starting his job on the cruises. The day before he started working, we were allowed to experience a day cruise so Ivan could see what he would be doing on the boats. Two weeks later, my parents and I drove back down to Te Anau to celebrate New Years with my brother on his days off. We did a few walks and stayed at a place with an amazing view.</p>
