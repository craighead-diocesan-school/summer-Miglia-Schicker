<h1>
My Summer
</h1>

<h2>
Te Anau and Milford Sound
</h2>

<p>
During the summer, My family and I went down to Milford Sound as my brother Ivan was starting his job on the cruises. The day before he started working, we were allowed to experience a day cruise so Ivan could see what he would be doing on the boats. Two weeks later, my parents and I drove back down to Te Anau to celebrate New Years woth my brother on his days off. We did a few walks and stayed at a place with an amazing view.
